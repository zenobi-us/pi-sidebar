# TUI Extension Research

## Overview
Identify pi TUI extension APIs, component lifecycle constraints, and existing patterns for drawer-like UI so we can design an extension that fits the ecosystem.

## Deliverables
- Research document covering TUI extension points, rendering APIs, layout constraints, and focus management.
- Catalog of existing components or examples that influence the drawer design.
- Summary of potential challenges and considerations for implementing a side drawer in the pi TUI framework.
- Ways we can allow other extensions to integrate with the side drawer extension.

## Tasks
- task-a1c4e2f7-tui-extension-research.md
- research-6b7f2d1c-tui-extension-apis.md

## Dependencies
- Access to pi TUI documentation and code examples.

## Next Steps
- Define research questions and confirm sources.
- Execute research and record findings.
