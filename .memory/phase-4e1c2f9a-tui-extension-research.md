# TUI Extension Research

## Overview
Identify pi TUI extension APIs, component lifecycle constraints, and existing patterns for drawer-like UI so we can design an extension that fits the ecosystem.

## Deliverables
- Research document covering TUI extension points, rendering APIs, layout constraints, and focus management.
- Catalog of existing components or examples that influence the drawer design.

## Tasks
- TBD after research questions are defined and reviewed.

## Dependencies
- Access to pi TUI documentation and code examples.

## Next Steps
- Define research questions and confirm sources.
- Execute research and record findings.
