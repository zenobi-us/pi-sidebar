# Project Constitution

## Project Rules
- Use `.memory/` as the authoritative project management store.
- Keep `summary.md`, `todo.md`, and `team.md` accurate at all times.
- Every project starts with a single active epic before phases or tasks.
- Use explicit file naming conventions for all `.memory/` files.
- Commit memory changes separately with conventional commits.
- Never push changes without human review.

### Epic Lifecycle
- Define vision, success criteria, phases, and dependencies.
- Only one active epic unless explicitly approved.
- Do not archive epics until all phases complete and learnings are distilled.

### Phase Planning
- Phases describe milestones, not task lists.
- Require human review before task breakdown.

### Task Execution
- Keep task outcomes and lessons learned documented.
- Keep `.memory/todo.md` aligned with active tasks.

### Learning
- Capture significant learnings in dedicated learning files.
- Never archive learning or research files.
