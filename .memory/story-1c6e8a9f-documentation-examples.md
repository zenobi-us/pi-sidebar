# Documentation and Examples

## User Story
As a developer using the drawer extension, I want clear documentation and examples so I can adopt it quickly and safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README or docs section describes configuration options and default behavior.
- [ ] Example shows opening a right-side drawer and toggling via events.
- [ ] Constraints are documented (overlay lifecycle, width limits, focus notes).

## Context
Documentation should align with the API proposal and constraints discovered in research.

## Out of Scope
- Publishing to npm or release automation.

## Tasks
- task-2f5b7a9c-add-drawer-docs.md
