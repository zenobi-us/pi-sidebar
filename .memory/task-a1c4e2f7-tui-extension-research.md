# TUI Extension Research

## Objective
Identify pi TUI extension points, layout constraints, focus/input patterns, and any drawer-like examples to inform the API design.

## Related Story
N/A

## Steps
1. Review local pi-coding-agent and pi-tui docs/examples for TUI extension APIs.
2. Scan repository source for existing TUI components or extension usage.
3. Summarize layout, focus, and animation patterns relevant to a side drawer.
4. Identify potential implementation challenges and considerations.
5. Identify ways other extensions can integrate with the side drawer extension.
6. Record findings and references in a research document.

## Expected Outcome
A research document summarizing TUI extension APIs, constraints, relevant patterns, challenges, and integration options for other extensions.

## Actual Outcome
TBD

## Lessons Learned
TBD
