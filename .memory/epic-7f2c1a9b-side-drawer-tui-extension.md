# Side Drawer TUI Extension

## Vision/Goal
Create a pi-package that provides a TUI extension for rendering a side drawer, enabling consistent, reusable drawer UX across pi-based terminal interfaces.

## Success Criteria
- Extension renders a configurable left/right side drawer in the TUI.
- Drawer supports open/close transitions and focus management.
- Public API is documented with usage examples.
  - Provides some api to register sidebar blocks.
- Package builds and passes tests in the pi-sidebar repository.

## Phases
- Phase 1: Research current TUI extension points and constraints.
- Phase 2: Design API, UX behavior, and integration patterns.
- Phase 3: Implement extension, tests, and documentation.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Research and design.
- Week 2: Implementation and documentation.

## Dependencies
- Pi TUI extension APIs and component system.
- Existing pi-package build pipeline in this repository.
